# Identification and Semantic Segmentation of Aircraft

This project aims to accurately identify and perform semantic segmentation of aircraft in images. Using a dataset of labeled aircraft images and segmentation masks, we develop and train machine learning models to detect aircraft and differentiate them from other objects in a given scene.

## Project Overview
Aircraft identification and segmentation is essential in various fields, including defense, aviation management, and environmental monitoring. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a model capable of identifying aircraft and performing pixel-wise classification to distinguish aircraft from backgrounds.

## Installation
Clone the repository using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prajwal2212/Semantic-segmentation-of-aircrafts-Deep-Learning.git
cd Semantic-segmentation-of-aircrafts-Deep-Learning
```

## Usage
### Preprocess the Dataset
Parse the XML files to identify polygon's coordinates to enable model training.

### Run the Training Script
Use the provided Jupyter notebook or script to train the model.

### Inference
Run inference on test images to evaluate model performance.

## Training the Model
In this project, we used a U-Net model, which is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks. The model architecture can be customized and trained on the provided dataset.

## Evaluating the Model
Evaluation metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) and pixel accuracy are used to measure the model's performance.\
